Expectations will be at the highest levels but no one should expect immediate and automatic success.” – David Griffin, Cavaliers General Manager</em></p>
<p>LeBron James recently announced his return to his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers. Although the contract is only for 2 years rather than the usual 4, the King  made the decision to leave the Miami Heat, and go back. This star player’s choice to change teams shocked many and has definitely stirred the pot in basketball. But what do you do when your star player wants to “come home?” With 34% of <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101133464" target="_blank">people expecting (or wanting) to work</a> until they are at least 80, it’s not improbable for past team members to return to your office. However, there are a lot of questions to ask your leadership before they return. So, it all boils down to: what will it take to bring them back?</p>
<h3>Higher Tech Skills Expectations</h3>
<p>LeBron James has the notoriety and the technical skills to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers to enhance the performance of the team. Your team as well is ever evolving and changing, so the employee who was once a key figure in decision-making, may no longer know what’s in the best interest of the organization. Millennials are beginning to enter the office at a surprising rate as more and more graduate. By 2020, Millennials are expected to <a href="http://www.lifebenefits.com/lb/Aware/0512_EmpFocus.html" target="_blank">comprise at least half of the workforce</a>.</p>
<p>So can your (former) employees keep up with the changing tides and the new expectations for tech-savvy employees if they aren’t in the office? If their tech skills haven’t developed in the months or years they’ve been gone, would you want to take the time and energy to train them <i>again </i>when they left the first time? These are questions you need to ask yourself and their potential supervisors before making the hiring decision.</p>
<h3>Changing Company Culture</h3>
<p>As companies grow, their culture often changes with age. Stagnancy is rare among companies who have hit the growth stage when they have surpassed the start-up phase. In fact, many believe that a change in culture would not only be beneficial to employee growth, but 96% feel that a <a href="http://www.tlnt.com/2013/11/26/the-9-clear-steps-to-organizational-culture-change/" target="_blank">cultural shift in their organization is needed</a> also. That’s a reason many employees leave and return in a “prodigal son” fashion. They leave in hopes of finding a company culture matching what they feel they need, and ultimately return because they can’t find the culture they want anywhere else.</p>
<h3>A Change in Character</h3>
<p>Lebron has not only developed as a player, he has grown as a person. His level of professionalism is something the Cavaliers should have left him with. However, such is not the case. With time spent away from a company, employees tend to gain a better perspective of the organization and their place while they were there. Don’t burn bridges with employees who have left.</p>
<p>Then you have the team players, the employees, who would never leave no matter how much the competitors paid them. Carmelo Anthony of the New York Knicks took a potential loss in professional growth to stay with the team he felt was his first love. He won’t be paid nearly as much and probably won’t see a winning championship game; but Anthony would rather play for the team he loves than get paid to play for any others. Your team, no matter which players you lose, will always have the employees who are completely dedicated to the company goals and their work. Don’t lose sight of them when you see another star performer take the opportunity to jump ship before they are ready to leave their home team.</p>
<h3>What Can We Learn from LeBron’s Move?</h3>
<p><i>Uphold a standard of professionalism and don’t publicly speak poorly of exiting talent.</i></p>
<p>Your current employees take notice, and may just follow suit. There is a possibility they will want to eventually return to your team; they are more apt to make a difference upon their return. It stands to reason, then since they already know the position, it won’t be too hard for them to adapt to the shifts in culture. However, a former employee returning for corporate benefits doesn’t care about the organization’s goals, they simply want to fill the seat during the interim. If they are ready, willing, and prepared to return, assess your organization needs before you rehire them. Everyone wants their star player, but when should they give up their title?</p>

";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Justin Locke";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:40:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/";a:1:{s:7:"encoded";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7004:"<p>I think it&#8217;s fair to say that I am an expert, or at least, very exper-<em>ienced</em>, in the realm of arts education. Since leadership is an art form of sorts, I thought I would weigh in with an artistic perspective on leadership and management training.</p>
<p>When people talk about &#8220;arts education,&#8221; most of the time they are really referring to &#8220;craft education,&#8221; e.g., learning how to find the notes on a keyboard or a clarinet. That is an essential element of arts education, but it is not the same as the &#8220;art&#8221; part of it, which has much more to do with perception, imagination, one&#8217;s unique presence, and evoking emotional responses.</p>
<p>It is important to keep craft and art separate. This is because it is very easy, and very common, to get them out of balance.</p>
<p>Many people get by on their art even though they are short on craft. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTFUM4Uh_6Y">Pavarotti </a>could <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/573390/Pavarotti-confesses---he-cannot-read-music.html?pg=all">not read music</a>, but this did not get in his way. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-fGZzS2M1s">Arthur Fiedler</a> had no baton technique, but it did not prevent him from being the most successful conductor in history. &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc_qQvT1xLg" target="_blank">Fik-Shun</a>&#8220; won the title of America&#8217;s Favorite Dancer last year, even though he had minimal standard dance craft training compared to his competitors.</p>
<p>But while many people get by despite having minimal craft, many people are defeated by having too much of it. Too much craft can fog up your perception, suppress your imagination, shame the imperfections that make you unique, make you afraid of your audience, and just delay everything generally.</p>
<p>Just one example, when I wrote my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Real-Men-Dont-Rehearse-Professional-ebook/dp/B008AF2CN0/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=8-1&amp;qid=1242310076">first book</a>, I was scared to death of failure and rejection, so I bought and read every book I could find on how to get published. Sad to say, I spent so much time reading these books and following their many detailed systems for success that I ended up never actually . . . you know . . . publishing a book. Years later, it was only due to a sense of total desperation that I finally took on the &#8220;art&#8221; of it. With guts a-churning, I sent a check and a pdf file to a book printer. Three weeks later, I was &#8220;published,&#8221; and four months later, I had sold every typo-laden copy. The &#8220;experts&#8221; had given me lots of nifty advice, but they had not given me the courage to simply place the order and put the book on display. In fact, they had sort of gotten in the way of it.  I could tell you identical stories about learning how to <a href="http://youtu.be/XilS50JWpdI?t=2m39s" target="_blank">play the bass</a>, how to dance, and how to be a public speaker.  All too often, lessons in craft get in the way of the art.</p>
<p>In a world where &#8220;content is king,&#8221; many people promote themselves by publishing advice on how to manage and lead. It is all done with the best of intentions, but beyond a certain point, the sheer volume of it makes it a time-consuming liability.  The &#8220;art&#8221; of leading is made of your own odd combination of desire, perception, courage, imagination, and personal presence. If those imperfect elements are suppressed, no external system or craft can take their place.</p>
<p>So here I am giving out yet more management advice, but in this case the advice is to ignore my advice. Sure, feedback and coaching are essential to cultivating your talents, but one must be careful not to become overly deferential to an outside system. As Dorothy learned in the Wizard of Oz, there are some things that no one can teach you, you have to figure them out for yourself. Don&#8217;t let too much leadership craft get in the way of your leadership art.</p>

Or to rearrange their day for you without telling them why? Or order them out to buy you a sandwich?</p>
<p>Those might sound like stupid examples, but they’re real cases of ways people behave in the workplace, and they raise questions about the power of corporate culture.</p>
<p>A colleague of mine was once sent out to buy a sandwich by an executive in her organization. This colleague wasn’t his PA or an administrative assistant. It wasn’t her job to smooth out his day. She was a trained project leader, a change manager and responsible for training hundreds of colleagues in technical skills. But this executive expected that, because he was more senior, the needs of others should come second to his need to avoid a three-minute walk to the shops.</p>
<p>Where do these attitudes come from, and how can we free ourselves of them?</p>
<h3>Welcome to the Jerk Zone</h3>
<p>Why are attitudes like this allowed to flourish in the workplace? Why is entitlement, selfishness and ego allowed, even encouraged, in some of the leading workplaces of the modern world?</p>
<p>Some slither of it probably comes from the dog-eat-dog capitalism that was idealized in the 1980s. Triumphal egoists were idolized as value makers and we were told that greed would build a better world. But anyone who’s worked in reality knows that this is not the case. Cooperation, collaboration, and humility – these are the ways to build lasting working relationships, to get the real work done. That ‘80s template of macho management should have died with the financial disasters that followed in its wake, taking traditional unthinking deference to seniority in its wake.</p>
<p>But much of that behavior remains, discredited as it has become, and for much the same reasons it was allowed to rise. Because the rest of us are too timid to say no.</p>
<p>Part of this comes from humility. Uncertain of our own value we accept the assumed value of others, even when it becomes over-inflated with their egos. We feel insecure in our own value, and so lack the confidence to challenge the more confident. We accede to this culture, which can turn a workplace into a Jerk Zone, a place where it is acceptable to behave with unchecked selfishness.</p>
<p>But worse than this, if we’re not careful we help build the Jerk Zone. We worry about <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/03/are-you-the-real-you-in-the-office/" target="_blank">being seen as perfect in our roles</a>, even though perfection itself is an impossible dream. This feeds our anxieties and insecurities, leading us to put on an over-compensating front. We inflate our own egos, like birds puffing up their chest feathers in an act of display. We too start to act the role the Jerk Zone creates for us.</p>
<h3>Would you act like that at home?</h3>
<p>We’ve all heard it at some point in our lives, the eternal cry of teachers faced with unacceptable behavior – ‘would you do that at home?’</p>
<p>If we want to get rid of the Jerk Zone, to change the corporate culture that can drive us mad, then we should ask that question again – of ourselves and of the people around us.</p>
<p>Our work and our lives aren’t separate. The same set of values that we hold up at home and in the public sphere should hold in the workplace. After all, do honesty or consideration stop mattering when we step through the office doors? Of course not. If we act lie they do then we are building a toxic space that can do no good for anyone within it. That’s the Jerk Zone, that takes decent people and turns them into objectionable egoists.</p>
<p>Would that executive have got away with ordering someone at home to go out and buy his sandwich? At home we expect respect, consideration, explanations. We can expect the same at work. To do any less is to treat ourselves and those around us with less dignity than we deserve.</p>
<h3>I want to break free</h3>
<p>How can we liberate ourselves from this toxic culture? How can we leave the Jerk Zone far behind?</p>
<p>Part of it, as with any management challenge, is asking ‘why?’ It’s a question so simple and so powerful that it crops up again and again in leadership thinking, from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys" target="_blank">Toyota Production System</a> to the work of <a href="https://www.startwithwhy.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Simon Sinek</a>. Look at where selfish behavior is strongest in your organization, ask why it is happening there and then work to root out the causes, whether it’s unhealthy processes, inappropriate measures or simply unchecked bad behavior.</p>
<p>Empower your workers to speak their views, and stand up for them when they challenge the big egos, even when they challenge you. Believing you are too important to be wrong is a step deep into the Zone. Empowering everyone to constructively challenge each other is a way to battle it, to keep the egos in check and show everyone that they don’t need to over-assert their personalities to be heard.</p>
<p>Above all listen. If you listen to others’ views and treat them with as much weight as your own then they will learn to do the same. A culture of receptiveness, humility and cooperation will start to spread, banishing that Jerk Zone to the past where it belongs.</p>
<p>You can leave the Jerk Zone, and take your whole organization with you. All you have to lose is your ego.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">With all this emphasis on attaining new customers, what we are doing to retain our current customers?  According to a study conducted by marketing guru, Dan Kennedy, here are the reasons that a customer leaves:</p>
<ul>
<li>1% die</li>
<li>3% move away</li>
<li>5% follow a friend or relative’s advice and switch to their recommended supplier</li>
<li>9% switch due to a better price or better product</li>
<li>14% switch due to product or service dissatisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the first two reasons may be out of your control, you should be able to do something about the other three.  However, all of the reasons above still only account for a total of 32%. So, why do the other 68% of customers leave a business? Simply put, they leave because they feel unappreciated, unimportant and taken for granted.</p>
<p>Customer turnover is costing businesses billions of dollars each year.  Here are some startling statistics from Emmett C. Murphy and Mark A. Murphy, in their report, “Leading on the Edge of Chaos:”</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtaining new customers can cost as much as five times more than retaining current customers</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Increasing customer retention by 2% has the same effect on profits as cutting costs by 10%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The average company loses 10% of its customers each year</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reducing customer defection by 5% can increase profits by 25-125%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The customer profitability rate tends to increase over the life of a retained customer</li>
</ul>
<p>Wow – is that a wake-up call or what?  Let’s take a look at how you can stop spending so much money trying to attract new clients and instead, learn to take care of the customers you already have.</p>
<p>Here are 10 Strategies that you can begin to implement TODAY for massive results:</p>
<h3>1.  Keep in touch regularly and systematically.</h3>
<p>When your customer places an order, follow up with them to see how satisfied they are with your product and/or service. Invite feedback – both positive and negative. (Chances are you’ll learn more from the negative feedback) Let your customers know that you care about them for the long term and not just for a one-shot deal.  Take the time to learn as much as you can about your customers during your follow up calls. A little extra effort can lead to your clients inquiring about other products or services that you offer and you’ll gain new business.  Since it’s always easier to sell more to someone you’re already doing business with, think of the lifetime value of each and every one of your customers.</p>
<h3>2.  Educate your customers with valuable, FREE information.</h3>
<p>Sharing your knowledge via a newsletter, social media updates, special reports and blogs will prove your expertise.  Providing value will also set you part from all the others that are merely promoting their products and services in every communication.  In BNI (Business Networking International), the philosophy is “Givers Gain.”  Be a giver.  Pay attention to the issues that are important to your customer and make it a point to find answers for them.  You’ll become the go-to person for both information and their business.</p>
<h3>3. Become a Resource.</h3>
<p>Look for other ways that you can serve your customers, even if it doesn’t mean an immediate return on your efforts.  Look for occasions when you can refer business, help out with an event or offer suggestions to improve their business.  In your clients’ mind, you’ll be the expert and will thereby be “top of mind” for the next time they are looking for your product or service.  As you get to know your customers better, you’ll be able to offer them assistance in a variety of areas. Networking events can play a critical role in meeting the “right people” to refer to other “right people.”  Be a conduit and you could become your customer’s hero.</p>
<h3>4. Write a note of appreciation.</h3>
<p>When you send a personalized card or note through the mail (not an e-card), you are setting yourself apart, big time. Not only is a card a pleasant diversion from the junk mail and bills that your customers are used to getting on a daily basis, it adds a personal touch to the relationship, which is priceless.  Think about it, you are giving your customer tangible evidence that you value them and support them.  Chances are that that card is going to be hanging on their bulletin board or displayed on their desk.  When someone picks up the card or asks about it, YOUR name is going to get mentioned – in a good way.  Great opportunity for referrals!</p>
<h3>5. Respond to customers promptly when they contact your business.</h3>
<p>Take care of issues immediately.  Ignoring problems doesn’t make them go away, it just makes them bigger and harder to correct. Remember what your mother told you: If you make a mistake, say you&#8217;re sorry. Then make things right. Let your customers know that you are committed to a high level of service and that you will do whatever it takes to resolve their issues.  Chances are, it will take a lot less than you think it will to completely satisfy (and keep) your customer.  There is a study that showed that only 17% of customers would give a second chance to a company that makes a mistake.  However, you greatly improve the chances of repeat business when you go beyond their expectations to solve their problems.</p>
<h3>6. Pay attention.</h3>
<p>Listening to what your customer has to say will provide clues that will help you provide a more personal touch.  If your customer talks about their brand new grandchild, send a congratulatory card.  If he or she has a child heading off to college, jot a note on the calendar and make sure you ask about it next time you talk to them.  Find out birthdays and anniversary dates.  Send cards for nontraditional occasions.  Remember, you may be the only person that has taken the time to send them a card.  It may be a cliché, but people don’t care what you know until they know that you care.  Ok, one more cliché – you have two ears and one mouth – they should be used in that proper proportion.</p>
<h3>7.  Act with integrity.</h3>
<p>In everything you do, you want your stakeholders and customers to trust you. Developing trust takes time, yet it can be lost in an instant.  When you say you are going to do something, do it.  When a mistake is made, admit it, and then make it right.  Do whatever you can to earn your customer’s unwavering belief in you and your business.  Remember, confidence must be earned continuously. People want to do business with and work for trustworthy companies.</p>
<h3>8.  Maintain Quality.</h3>
<p>No matter how good your customer service is, if you’re providing an inferior product or service, your customers are going to leave.  Make sure all of your employees are aware of the importance of maintaining quality.  Put systems into place to monitor it.  If you have any products that are outsourced, rigorously insure that your quality standards are met.</p>
<h3>9.  Reward Customers.</h3>
<p>Institute a customer loyalty program.  Give your customers coupons they can use for their next order.  Surprise them occasionally with a free gift.  Hold a “Customer Appreciation Event.”  Look for different and unique ways that you can delight your customers.</p>
<h3>10. Do Good.</h3>
<p>Establish a relationship with a nonprofit or charity and invite other local businesses to participate.  Share what you’re doing in your newsletter and in your social media campaigns.  Remind people when they patronize your business that they are contributing to a greater cause.</p>
<p>All of these strategies work, but don’t overwhelm yourself thinking that you have to perform them perfectly right now.  It’s important to get started moving your customer relationships forward. Choose one technique that you feel that you are already doing well, then brainstorm some creative ways you can do it even better.</p>
<p>You may want to rank these ideas in order of importance or impact to your bottom line. Implement systems, one key point at a time, until you see progress and then move to the next one. Paying consistent attention to the way you acknowledge your clients will pay off in way that may surprise you. Go for it!</p>

<p>Last week <a title="#TChat Recap: The Extraordinary Potential Of Values Based Leadership" href="http://www.talentculture.com/tchat-recaps/tchat-recap-the-extraordinary-potential-of-values-based-leadership/" target="_blank">we talked about values based leadership</a> and this week we’re going to talk about the state of HR Technology with a co-chair of Human Resource Executive’s HR Technology® Conference and a technology editor for LRP Publications. He also writes an HR blog and hosts the HR Happy Hour Show, a radio program and podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, that guy — Mr. Steve Boese.</p>
<p>Employee engagement and recognition, company culture, cloud computing, HR data management, talent analytics and integrated HR and talent acquisition and management systems continue to be hot trends in the HR tech space, not to mention social collaboration and video (from recruitment to onboarding to core talent management).</p>
<p>And a better user experience to boot is what it’s all about today. There’s a renaissance of new edge applications improving recruiting, learning and talent engagement, and HR buyers are more sophisticated that ever before.</p>
<p>And we have a bonus round. Our #TChat community members <a href="http://www.hrtechconference.com/register.html">can get $600 off of the HR Tech Conference full rate (expires August 4).</a> Pssst…the secret code is TW14 (case sensitive).</p>
<p>This year’s HR Technology Conference &amp; Exposition is coming up fast (October 7-10), so join #TChat co-creators and hosts <a href="http://www.twitter.com/meghanmbiro" target="_blank">Meghan M. Biro</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kevinwgrossman" target="_blank">Kevin W. Grossman</a> as we learn more about the state of HR technology with this week’s guest: <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveBoese" target="_blank">Steve Boese</a>, a co-chair of Human Resource Executive’s HR Technology® Conference and a technology editor for LRP Publications.</p>

<p>We simply made it up. Neither of us had really had any formal lessons; I know I never had them. My stiff “pin-hips” as my mom and dad had always pointed out were no match for any boogie-woogie, hustle or swing, not even the tipsy white-boy sway I recalled trying to pull off one too many times. Also, rock and roll air guitar and drums do not count. Ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-28247" alt="Leadership" src="http://www.talentculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Amy-Kevin-Dancing.jpeg" width="640" height="433" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, my now wife, then fiancée, had always, and still has, the disco-lemonade rhythm. In other words, she can dance. Naturally. With uninhibited hip-shaking bliss. So with my sweat and perseverance and pin-hips, and her with her rhythmic flow, we proceeded to put our very own wedding dance together to our song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QIWtY7gzvA">“Biggest Part of Me” by Ambrosia</a>.</p>
<p>We also wrote our own vows based on mutual respect, but we weren’t all about two becoming one, we were all about two halves making two wholes, reveling in our individuality and differences just as much as our shared values.</p>
<p>A few years after we were married we took dance lessons for a while, really pushing me, and even my lovely wife, out of our comfort zones to learn different dances. Which is why we became and still are such huge <a href="http://www.fox.com/dance/">So You Think You Can Dance</a> fans, the dancing competition show that gives change management new meaning, each week pushing the young dancers to learn other styles, regardless of how much training they had prior to making it on the show. (Do note that a few of the SYTYCD dancers have eventually become choreographers.)</p>
<p>That’s why the biggest part of leadership is me. I mean you. And me.  It’s starts “here” – inside [hand to heart]. We now have a family and are its leadership, and although we’re still individuals with differences, we have developed a healthy amount of collaborative codependence, one partner leading the other and then switching roles, knowing when to delegate, when to make collective decisions, and when to go forth confidently alone.</p>
<p>Yes, it takes two to tango. And 200 can, too. And even 200,000. As <a href="http://www.talentculture.com/tchat-previews/tchat-preview-the-extraordinary-potential-of-values-based-leadership/">Mark Fernandes</a> put’s it:</p>
<p><i>You gotta find your dance floor when it comes to leadership.</i></p>
<p>And that takes a whole lotta practice and continuous learning and leading. Mark is the Chief Leadership Officer of Luck Companies, a global <a href="http://www.talentculture.com/tchat-recaps/tchat-recap-the-extraordinary-potential-of-values-based-leadership/">Values Based Leadership</a> (VBL) organization, and he knows as well as I that leadership development isn’t anything new.</p>
<p>In fact, according to <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/leading_in_the_21st_century/why_leadership-development_programs_fail">McKinsey &amp; Company</a>, US companies spend almost $14 billion annually on leadership development, and it’s a top-three human capital executive priority.</p>
<p>However, “around 30 percent of US companies admit that they have failed to exploit their international business opportunities fully because they lack enough leaders with the right capabilities.”</p>
<h3>Where too many halves make no wholes.</h3>
<p>That list goes on, and I’m sure you’ve read other articles and research on “why leadership fails.” What’s clear today is that all employees (i.e., learners as future leaders) today care about different things and their expectations from business in their roles as associates, customers, investors, and community members are changing rapidly.</p>
<p>All organizations and their leaders have to push themselves constantly to bend without breaking the break dance floor. Mark Fernandes also shared that the culture of any organization is an extended shadow of leadership. For business leaders to successfully transform themselves and bring others along with them, they must come from a place of passion, purpose, competency and authenticity.</p>
<h3>Ballroom spinners caught in a serious moonlight.</h3>
<p>But now we’re doing too many solos. According to a recent <a href="http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/view/story.jhtml?id=534357334">HRE article by Peter Cappelli</a>, organizational leadership has shifted emphasis from committee-based, collaborative decision-making systems, too much greater individual accountability. This in turn has impacted leadership’s ability to delegate decisions and they have transformed into are “judges” where employees may make suggestions, “but they, the leaders, decide.”</p>
<p>You can only imagine what this does to morale, employee engagement, productivity, innovation, all the business bingo buzzwords being swept away from a dark and dirty empty dance hall floor, which is why we must always:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Prep the halves.</strong> We fall in and out of love with our jobs all the time. Some more than others. You may not want to love your job or the company you work for, but you gotta want to love what you do, when you do it, how you do it, who you do it with and for, and how you get better at it. The ability to celebrate our differences with ourselves and others, while challenging ourselves to be better, is where personnel leadership starts – and where long-tail leadership follows.</li>
<li><strong>To make the wholes.</strong> Even with all the pressures of the marketplace, shareholders, attracting and retaining talent, leadership today should return to a greater union of collaborative codependency and continuously developing and making one another better. We all gotta find our dance floor and then let our teammates walk across that junior high gym floor to ask them for the pleasure of making some business magic, being literal leaders, project managers or individual high performers.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may not want to call it a marriage, but that’s why staying in love is hard work and at the very heart of business, the halves and wholes of leadership.</p>

What do they have to do with one another? My answer: Everything. They are the two primary components of hiring, the process of moving a candidate from job offer to day one, and must be considered collectively when creating this mission-critical process and making associated technology decisions. Doing so will reduce inefficiency for Human Resources, the hiring manager, and most importantly, the new hire.</p>
<h3>The Yin</h3>
<p>Pre-employment screening is a high touch service. It involves online and offline research, personal contact, and significant manual processing. Increasingly, the industry is finding new and better ways to automate, but it’s still very reliant upon people and the service they deliver. Organizations will typically select a screening provider based on the combination of service, turnaround time, accuracy, and cost. Screening is often perceived as a necessary evil, a hurdle to overcome as quickly as possible, with very little thought going into the overarching hiring process and how it should be structured to administer screening in a more efficient and consistent way.</p>
<h3>The Yang</h3>
<p>Onboarding, on the other hand, is entirely a software-driven experience, where process design, employment branding, forms automation and socialization come into play. It’s all about ease of use, workflow compliance, and the new hire’s time to productivity. It is where HR understandably spends more of their time, as they work diligently to bring on top talent quickly and efficiently. HR needs to set up new employees for success, and hopefully, a long and productive career with their organization. Technology shines here, solving workflow and compliance complexities.</p>
<h3>The Yin and Yang of Hiring</h3>
<p>When considering the relationship between screening and onboarding, it is easier to explore from the perspective of the candidate. Screening and onboarding interactions are his or her first contact with the new employer. These interactions are, in effect, the first <i>real</i> experience with the corporate culture. Where recruiting is quite often a sales and marketing exercise, with a primary focus on attracting and closing top talent, the hiring process at most companies (job offer to day one) is where reality sets in. It is very complex, administrative in nature, and can either be cobbled together through an array of point solutions or optimized under a single technology and service platform. With a single platform comes workflows that are considerate of the entire process—from offer letter approval and issuance, to background screening authorizations and disputes, to employment eligibility verification (yes, E-Verify as well). A single platform brings a single candidate experience, a process without <i>any</i> paper or fax, with <i>zero</i> redundant data entry, a <i>single</i> support team, and total focus on the desired outcome of minimal hassle and faster time to engagement and productivity.</p>
<p>Take a look at the first step in the hiring process—the offer letter. Most companies issue an offer contingent upon a successful background screen and/or drug test. Background screening requires an FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act) disclosure, a signed authorization, and often some personal information that may not have been collected during the recruiting process (date of birth, SSN, etc). This critical step, the process of extending a job offer, is quite complex. A smart hiring process is considerate of this complexity, uniting these tasks behind a single, secure, mobile-friendly login. It should be a convenient offer process that increases the likelihood that the offer is accepted, followed immediately by the electronic disclosure and authorizations necessary to begin the background screening process. Fast and easy—good!  Slow and disconnected—not good! What may feel like a check-in-the-box for HR when the screening report is returned can be far more onerous for the candidate, and filled with administration, logistics (think drug testing), phone calls, faxes, emails and multiple logins.</p>
<p>Once the offer is signed and screening is complete, the company is presumably ready to move forward with the onboarding process involving new hire forms, workspace and IT requisitions, employment eligibility verification and more. Once again, more complex than it may seem. A smart hiring process is considerate of this, uniting these tasks seamlessly behind a single, secure, mobile-friendly login. A candidate should expect to sign the I-9 form in the <i>same system</i> and at the <i>same time </i>as the W4, state tax forms, and the rest of the company new hire forms. Yet because there is a tendency to manage the hiring process in a piecemeal fashion, companies procure and cobble together point solutions, taking a checklist approach to digitizing and automating the steps of a process without thinking about the process as a whole and the outcomes desired. While there are endless HR technology solutions for discrete pieces of the hiring process, each marking a box on a checklist, a comprehensive approach to process design and technology selection is needed to create a positive and differentiated hiring experience.</p>
<h3>A Closer Look&#8230;</h3>
<p>Take a close look at your organization’s hiring process from the perspective of your new hire. Count the number of interactions you require of him or her. How many separate logins, emails and notifications are there, from the minute you send the offer letter until the new hire is fully productive and enrolled in benefits, payroll and your other corporate systems? It’s probably more than you think. Look for bottlenecks where the hiring process comes to a screeching halt while you wait for the candidate, an employee, or a point solution vendor to respond. Then imagine what a smart hiring process could bring, reducing the number of interactions, the amount of data entry and the bottlenecks, while allowing the process to flow seamlessly and in accordance with your pre-defined corporate policies.</p>
<p>Screening and onboarding go together, because for the candidate, they are linked. HR needs a hiring process that is the perfect marriage of service and technology, of stellar human interactions and flawless technology experiences, to differentiate themselves as an employer. Disrupt the traditional hiring checklist. Transform your process. Create a superior experience for your new hires and set them up for a short road to productivity and a long road with your organization.</p>

And to hear him tell it, that line is blurring. The face companies put forward to job seekers is increasingly just part of the overall brand message—making the employer brand more important than ever, says Wheatland, who has a background in both the talent world and the marketing arena. He currently serves as head of strategy at content marketing firm King Content, but spent eight years as global head of thought leadership for staffing giant Kelly Services. A sought-after speaker and one of LinkedIn’s Top 25 Social Media Experts, we were keen to get Wheatland’s take on the shifting landscape of employer brand.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, he shared his insight on brands and their importance in all aspects of today’s business.</p>
<h3>Ed: You talk about the need for “convergence” when it comes to the overall company brand and the employer brand. Can you say more about that?</h3>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong> I’m a big proponent of content marketing, or basically companies acting as publishers. That model has proven so successful in terms of business-to-business and business-to-consumer marketing. But there’s been this big gulf between what companies were doing to the outside world with those things, and what companies were still doing around the way they viewed talent, and brought talent on board, and managed talent. You’ve got different parts of the company responsible for different ways of dealing with the outside world. Increasingly, no one outside of your company cares about your silos.</p>
<h3>Ed: Can you give an example?</h3>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong> Starbucks is a great example. Something like 80 percent of all job applicants to Starbucks are already Starbucks customers. So what kind of business impact is there when someone who’s applying to Starbucks has a negative experience? When they start sharing that negative experience with their networks, and you start multiplying that by the hundreds of thousands of people who take that step to apply each year.</p>
<p>Many companies now are starting to realize there’s something to this, and we’ve got to start acting more holistically. A company brand, the employer brand and the personal brands of our employees—these are all somehow strongly connected. And we’ve got to start thinking about them in a holistic way, because any one of them can have a negative impact on the other.</p>
<h3>Ed: What’s the best way to promote an employer brand today?</h3>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong> Don’t fake it. Again, there’s been a huge change in the way companies market in the past five years. Instead of “pushing” a message out to the marketplace, you’re actually drawing people in through genuine exchanges. You’re not trying to shove a sales message down people’s throats. You’re trying to basically just talk about and help people solve their challenges. Rather than thinking, “Gee, what does our audience want to hear, and let’s give them that,” with employer branding, you’ve really got to start by looking within.</p>
<p>Put aside the external perception of what your employer brand is for the moment, and really focus on what the internal reality or culture of working for the organization is.</p>
<h3>Ed: What if it stinks at the moment? How do you deal with a crummy culture on route to developing a better one?</h3>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong> People love stories of challenge and change. Companies are typically really bad at telling stories. A good story involves challenges and overcoming obstacles and mistakes. Companies don’t like to talk about mistakes. But if you try to tell a story that’s too removed from reality, you’re going to get found out. In this environment, that’s just not a sustainable way.</p>
<p>You need to lead with, “This is the reality now,” and paint a vision of the future: “This is how we see it, and you are part of the new guard and we’re going to work together to steer this ship in a new direction.” It’s a way of telling a story that’s a reflection of the reality.</p>
<h3>Ed: What’s the role of employee voices in the kind of employer brand you’re talking about?</h3>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong> If people are genuinely empowered and allowed to share their positive experience of working in an organization, that has a net loyalty impact on the employee, as well as ticking those boxes, if you will, of what the external market is looking for in terms of communication these days. That is to say, genuine, lower-level employees telling true stories.</p>
<p>It helps to attract like-minded people to an organization. People who are more likely to fit in. Recruiters spend so much of their day just wading through hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of applicants for a job, many of which are totally inappropriate. It’s a bad experience for everyone, and a huge time waste for recruiters.</p>
<h3>Ed: You’re suggesting a high level of transparency.</h3>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong> Tell the stories. If you have a culture where you have Friday night drinks every week, that would be fantastic or an absolute deal breaker, depending on the candidate looking at it. Am I going to have to work late, do an all-nighter because a project comes in on a Tuesday that no one was expecting? Tell that stuff.  Historically, no one wants to tell that story. We think it is better to get the applicants than not to get the applicants.</p>
<p>But what the “culture branding” mindset leads to is that you can have the most impact by helping people deselect in the first place. So rather than having 100 applicants for a job why not have 10 who actually could be a good culture fit.</p>

<p>What does it mean to be a leader? It is about being the one who gives the orders? Is it about building relationships with people through values? This week’s #TChat topic: <a href="http://www.talentculture.com/tchat-previews/tchat-preview-the-extraordinary-potential-of-values-based-leadership/" target="_blank">The Extraordinary Potential Of Values Based Leadership</a>, shares a very unique perspective on what leadership should be all about. Fortunately for us this week, our guest: <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkSFernandes" target="_blank">Mark Fernandes</a>, Chief Leadership Officer of Luck Companies, a global Values Based Leadership (VBL) organization, is an expert on this highly buzzworthy topic. And why it shouldn’t it be buzzworthy? Leadership is responsible for managing people and their level of engagement with their organizations.</p>
<p>Mark kickoffs #TChat with explaining what Values Based Leadership means to him, but what it should mean to others:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>A1: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VBL?src=hash">#VBL</a> is about loving your associates to death, giving them something to believe in, &amp; helping them become everything they can. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TChat?src=hash">#TChat</a></p>
<p>— Mark Fernandes (@MarkSFernandes) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkSFernandes/statuses/489554022056329216">July 16, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async=""></script>Mark brings up two intuitive points about leadership: give your people something to believe in, and help them grow. Value Based Leadership brings leaders and employees together to share a common goal and purpose. Leadership plays a pivotal role in how employees develop, and how the tone for workplace culture is set. Mark believes that:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>
A2: An orgs culture is the shadow of a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/leader?src=hash">#leader</a>, therefore the culture &amp; climate they create is replicated by the associates. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VBL?src=hash">#VBL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TChat?src=hash">#TChat</a> — Mark Fernandes (@MarkSFernandes) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkSFernandes/statuses/489555995006599168">July 16, 2014</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Leaders that truly lead, inspire their employees to do great things. They understand that attitude, motivation, and productivity around the office is reflected on how well they lead. Creating a stimulating culture and climate for employees to thrive in has to come from personal self-realization of what it takes to lead. To be a leader, you must:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>
A3: Know yourself, take time to know those around you, and surround yourself with people who challenge you to be better. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tchat?src=hash">#tchat</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/vbl?src=hash">#vbl</a> — Kate Bischoff (@k8bischHRLaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/k8bischHRLaw/statuses/489558611719634944">July 16, 2014</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p><script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async=""></script>Yes, self-realization of who you are and taking the time to learn about those around you is why leaders are who they are. How can you expect people to follow you if you don’t know anything about them? How can you expect to inspire greatness? As a leader, you must remember:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>A3: (1) You don&#8217;t know it all&#8230; listen! (2) Give more than you get. (3) Remember to say thank you to those who make a difference. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TChat?src=hash">#TChat</a></p>
<p>— Tom Bolt (@TomBolt) <a href="https://twitter.com/TomBolt/statuses/489558411168595968">July 16, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Values Based Leadership takes the time to value people, to hear their needs, and build a culture shared around a common goal. Making a difference starts with these steps. Few put in the effort and those that do see the huge benefits. If you want value, then you need to create it, and then share it with the rest. Because today’s workforce want to work for a common purpose. They want to build a better tomorrow. So give them the opportunity to do so.<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want to be when you will grow up?&#8221;- a famous question we all have faced and had to answer in our childhood days. With starry eyes full of ambition and heart full of high hopes you may have answered that you want to be an actor or a doctor or teacher, lawyer, astronaut, firefighter. You may have also dreamed of a job that would give you rich mansions with butlers and maids, cars. But when you really grow up, things may have changed. The reality around you might have reshaped that it has diverted your vision of your dream job. In a  situation like this it is may be difficult for you to chase or choose your dream job but it is never impossible. These 7 tips will help you to find your dream job.</p>
<h3>Analyze your ambition</h3>
<p>A good analysis of your ambition will help you to find your dream job. You have to know what is your dream job. What suits you the best as a job? The British born philosopher Alan Watts said that to know what job is the best fit for a person can be found out by asking a simple question. ‘What would you do if money were no object?’. What would you do if you won a lottery and don’t need to do anything for a living? The answers of these questions will lead one to understand his or her ambition.</p>
<h3>Know your greatest talent and purpose</h3>
<p>In this step you have to be completely objective about yourself. You need to point out your skills and strengths. You can take others advice or opinion into account. You also have to know about your weak points. Once you get the clear indications about your skills, strengths or weaknesses, then you can clearly connect them to choose your path. On the other hand the purpose of your life should be made clear to you. You must know for which reasons you are chasing your dream job. It will help you to not leave the dreams behind.</p>
<h3>Being realistic</h3>
<p>Not all the jobs full of money are the one of your dreams and not all the dream jobs are currency maker.  You have to take that into account. Your dream job might not be that much financially rich. If you want to earn money, then you have to sort out those types of jobs which will accomplish your needs. But those who are willing to follow your passion should keep in mind that when you follow your passion money often comes too.</p>
<h3>Keep calm and patient</h3>
<p>You need<b> </b>to keep calm and patient in finding your dream job. The more nervous or anxious we become in finding our dream job, the more prone we become to take actions that won’t help. Happy endings are often obstacles for not being patient. It might take years to achieve success on dream job, but you need to follow the path you have chosen from the heart.</p>
<h3>Commit to find your job or create it</h3>
<p>It is very important to be committed to the path towards your dream job. An audacious goal is never achieved without proper commitment. Either you have to find the job that fits you the most with all your potentials or you must be that much devoted to make a way to create it for yourself.</p>
<h3>Consider the ups and downs of your dream job</h3>
<p>This one is one of the most important to find your dream job. There must be some difficulties in your job besides the positive side. You have to be well aware about them. You must have to research the positivity and negativity of your dream job. The more you will be aware about them,  the more you will be certain to find what is your dream job.</p>
<h3><b>Buckling up yourself</b></h3>
<p>Doing some volunteer works or other jobs related to your dream jobs will certainly make you sure about if you have found your dream job yet or not. Besides, it will help to boost your confidence and enrich your CV. It will also help you to get experience which is a crucial factor for getting your dream job.</p>
<p>The famous Chinese philosopher Confucius said that ‘Find a job you enjoy and you will never work a day in your life.’ Finding a dream job will make your life easier to move on. But dream jobs can be also hard in nature too. But life is certainly easier when you are working with something you love. So never stop believing in yourself and always look for what suits you the most.</p>
